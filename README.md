##### ðŸ’¡ Projects
- Currently working on [*GitLet*](https://github.com/ZichengLiang/CS61B_sp21/tree/main/proj2), a CLI application which mimics *Git*'s basic behaviours.
  - This is from UC Berkeley's *CS61B: Data Structures and Algorithms*. I audited the course over the summer, more [projects and lab works](https://github.com/ZichengLiang/CS61B_sp21) are presented here.

- [Flight Data Visualisation](https://github.com/ZichengLiang/CSU10013_Flight_Data_Visualisation). This is a school project in which I worked as a backend developer and the team leader.
